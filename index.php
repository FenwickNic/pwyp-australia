				<div class='title'>THE RESOURCE CURSE</div>
				<div class='text'>
					<p>Many countries rich in finite natural resources such as oil, gas and minerals are burdened by their bounty instead of blessed by it. In fact two thirds of the world’s poorest people live in resource-rich countries.</p>
					<p>Why?</p>

					Residents of Sadiola village in Mali – like this young mother – have seen few benefits from the gold mine in their community. “Youth have no jobs and the men don’t have work at the mine,” says community leader Sora Sakiliba. “Thesedays, men usually have no money.”

					<p>
					Too often mining and oil and gas companies and governments keep their contracts and revenues secret, allowing mismanagement and corruption to flourish. Secrecy and corruption often result in the income from natural resource extraction going missing and not benefiting citizens, especially those living in poverty. Secrecy and corruption also stop poor communities getting access to basic services, like clean water, healthcare and sanitation.
					</p>
					<p>
					As the sovereign owners of a country’s natural resources, citizens have a right to know how much their government receives from companies who want access to those resources, and how revenues are being spent.

					A CONTINENT OF RICHES ?
				</div>
				<div class='text'>Africa is experiencing a major expansion in natural resource extraction and currently around 240 Australian mining companies operate on the continent. In 2010 the exports of minerals and oil and gas were worth roughly seven times the amount given to the continent in aid. Yet without improved transparency this natural wealth is unlikely to be turned into lasting benefits.</div>

					<p>Transparency of revenues from the sale of natural resources could help end corruption and ensure that this income is used for the public good. Thanks to pressure from Publish What You Pay, from the end of 2013 the United States followed by the European Union will require their mining and oil and gas companies to publish what they pay governments wherever they operate.</p>

Australia could help resource-rich but poor communities around the world that are seeking to hold their governments to account and introduce transparency legislation.</p>
					<p class='pull-right'>Mining taxes and royalties are often a topic of concern and controversy in Australia too. Greater transparency would help us understand the value of our nation’s natural resources.</p>
